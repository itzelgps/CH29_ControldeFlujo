Part 2

Now, create the function getDayNumber.

It should accept two parameters: janFirstDayNumber and yearDayNumber.

The yearDayNumber will be an int ranging from 0 to 365.

janFirstDayNumber will be an int ranging from 0 to 6, representing the day of the week of January 1st.

Your function should then calculate and return the day of the week corresponding to the yearDayNumber passed.

Hint: use the remainder operator (%), dividing your yearDayNumber by 7.

function getDayNumber(janFirstDayNumber, yearDayNumber) {
  if ((yearDayNumber >= 0) && (yearDayNumber <= 365) && (janFirstDayNumber >= 0) && (janFirstDayNumber <= 6))
  {
    return (janFirstDayNumber + (yearDayNumber - 1) % 7);
  }
} // getDayNumber

console.log(yearDayNumber(0, 121));
